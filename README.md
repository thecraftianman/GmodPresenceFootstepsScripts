# GmodPresenceFootstepsScripts
Scripts to give extra sounds to https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2591814455

This set of scripts adds some extra sounds to any supporting Presence Footsteps mods for Gmod. These can't be included with the actual Workshop mod because the Workshop does not allow the inclusion of these scripts when uploading.

**I DO NOT CLAIM TO HAVE MADE THESE SCRIPTS OR THE ACTUAL MOD.** I'm just reuploading them for the sake of preserving the mod, since almost all versions of it were taken down by the creator and I haven't been able to find a reason why.
I will take this down if the creator asks me to (if you're reading this, ask me on Steam instead of here)
